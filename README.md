### Features Left to Implement:

## Implementation and Process:
- I started coding with a navbar and a background image for the home page (index file). I separated the body into three sections, the header, the content and then the footer. 
- I added some introductory text on the home page.  
- I added a session section in the home page.
- I added social links to the footer.
- I created two more files: about and contact and pasted the content from the index file. 

After the initial planning session with my mentor I needed to: 
- Start with my wireframes for tablet and mobile devices (rookie misstake not doing it ahead as well as the UX planning).
- I added some introductory text on the about page.
- I added a form to the contact page.
- 1 added call to action buttons on the home page and on the about page.

After my mid-project session with my mentor I had the following changes to implement:
- Center align buttons and content.
- Implement css variables to shorten organize multiple code values.

After my end-of-project mentor session I had the following changes to implement:
- Change id attributes to class attributes through out the pages.
- Shorten the image names in the images folder.
- Add aria-labels to the links on the pages.
- Correct the responsive layout and media queries through out the pages.

## Testing:

- I ensured that all links directed to the correct pages and that certain links directed to specific sections of other pages.

  - Google Chrome

## Deployment
The site was deployed to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Using the following steps: 
- Create a repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README.MD file
- The root of your repository must contain an index.html file which will be the main page of your live GitHub Page.
- Go to repository settings, scroll to GitHub Pages and select the master branch for your source.
- Save the selection and when the page reloads the link to your live site will be in the GitHub Pages section. The link can take up to 1 hour to go live.
